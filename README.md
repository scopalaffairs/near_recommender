This repository contains the files used for the Capstone Project "NEAR Social Recommender - A recommender system for an on-chain social network" of the Data Science Bootcamp , Batch 03/2023 at Constructor.

This project was done in collaboration with [Pagoda](https://www.pagoda.co/), the software development company behind the NEAR Blockchain Operating System.

## Documentation

For a more detailed information about the codebase, please refer to the [Documentation](https://scopalaffairs.github.io/near_recommender/).


## NEAR Social

### Introduction

NEAR Social is a blockchain-based social network where users log in with their NEAR wallet address. All user actions, such as posting, following, liking, and updating their profile, are recorded on the public ledger as blockchain transactions. Users own their data, and developers can create permissionless open-source apps, known as widgets, to expand the platform's capabilities.

### Task

Our objective was to develop a user recommendation system that fosters network growth by connecting users with similar interests. To achieve this, we designed a system that utilizes on-chain data for each user. We employed four distinct recommendation algorithms, as illustrated in the architectural overview below:

- Top trending users
- Friends of friends
- Tag similarity 
- Post similarity

### Result

This recommender system is available through a widget on [near.org](https://near.org/)

## Technical details

This project used the on-chain data on the NEAR blockchain via the Databricks instance of Pagoda. We created SQL queries and tables as well as Data Science Notebooks.

## Methodologies

Among others, we explored the given datasets with the following methods:

- Friends of friends
  - XGBoost
  - RandomForest
- Trending users
  - NetworkX
  - Louvain community detection
- Tag/Post Similarity
  - Natural Language Processing, Cosine Similarity
  - Pooled word embeddings on Large Transformer Model, Cosine Similarity
- Hyperlink-Induced-Topic-Search (HITS) Algorithm
  - Graphs for visualization and exploration

### SQL queries

We created our own SQL tables using existing parsed tables to process the data to our needs. These tables include:

- **near_social_txs_clean**: transactions within the social.near contract without duplicates
- **graph_follows**: table showing users and follows in the form of graph edges
- **users_agg_metrics**: account and social network metrics by user

These tables can be found in the `sit` schema inside Databricks.

### Notebooks

Several notebooks inside and outside Databricks have been created to implement the different recommender algorithms. These can be found under `near_recommender/notebooks` inside this repository.


## Widget

The recommender system is going to be implemented as a widget.


## Visualization

Unveiling the web of network connections and community clusters, several iterations of visual interfaces gave us a comprehensive understanding of user relationships, facilitating trending user recommendations and fine tuning the models.

## Development

### 1. Package Management

This package is managed using `Poetry`, a Python package management tool. You can find more information about `Poetry` here: ![Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

To interact with Poetry's interface, make sure you have it installed.

Basic commands:

`poetry shell`

Activates a virtualenv for this project.

`poetry install`

Installs the requirements into the virtualenv.

`poetry add/remove <package>`

Installs/removes packages. Poetry automatically handles dependency version management. It is recommended to use these commands instead of manually changing versions in `pyproject.toml`.

Specific versions for a package can be installed by adding the version in ![PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) format. Refer to the ![dependency specification](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification) for more details.

`poetry update`

Updates the entire project.

`poetry build`

Builds a wheel from the package.

For more commands, consult the documentation provided by Poetry.

### 2. Python Version

We rely on Databricks LTS support for the Python version. Please refer to the `pyproject.toml` file for further information.


### Compiling the Documentation

The documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages from the docs branch, located in the /docs folder. To ensure smooth integration with GitHub, make sure to include an empty `.nojekyll` file in the compiled docs directory (project_root)/docs.

To build the documentation, use the provided

```
     make html
```

command in the documentation source directory, `near_recommender/docs/`.

To rebuild the documentation, you will need a Java runtime on your localhost and the Poetry virtual environment activated.
