---------

Our objective was to develop a user recommendation system that fosters network growth by connecting users with similar interests. To achieve this, we designed a system that utilizes on-chain data for each user. We employed four distinct recommendation algorithms, as illustrated in the architectural overview below:

- Top trending users

- Friends of friends

- Tag similarity

- Post similarity
