Introduction
=============

NEAR Social is a blockchain-based social network where users log in with their NEAR wallet address. 
All user actions, such as posting, following, liking, and updating their profile, are recorded on the public ledger as blockchain transactions. 
Users own their data, and developers can create permissionless open-source apps, known as widgets, to expand the platform's capabilities.
